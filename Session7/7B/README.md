# This is a read me for session 7.
## There are two problems which are being solved
## Create a Polygon Class:
##where initializer takes in:
##number of edges/vertices
##circumradius
##that can provide these properties:
### edges
### vertices
##interior angle
##edge length
##apothem
##area
##perimeter
##that has these functionalities:
##a proper __repr__ function
##implements equality (==) based on # vertices and circumradius (__eq__)
##implements > based on number of vertices only (__gt__)

## Second problem statement.
#Implement a Custom Polygon sequence type:
#where initializer takes in:
#number of vertices for largest polygon in the sequence
#common circumradius for all polygons
#that can provide these properties:
#max efficiency polygon: returns the Polygon with the highest area: perimeter ratio
#that has these functionalities:
#functions as a sequence type (__getitem__)
#supports the len() function (__len__)
#has a proper representation (__repr__)
